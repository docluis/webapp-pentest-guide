## 1 Determining Scope & Enumeration
*** 
### Enumerating The Application
```bash
ffuf -u "<URL>" -H "Host:FUZZ.<DOMAIN>" -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt //virtual hosts
ffuf -u "http<s>://FUZZ.<DOMAIN>" -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt //sub domains
gobuster dir -u <URL> -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-words.txt //find pages/endpoints
```
> Goal is getting an overview of potential attack vectors within the scope of testing specified in the contract / bounty program.

## 2 Understanding Functionality
***
Start by testing the website the intended way:  
- look for potential attack vectors and crutial endpoints
- note any unexpected behavior (like error logs exposed to the user)
- Identify the priviledge classes (unauthenticated, regular user, manager, admin, ...)
- check cookies set

## 3 Testing

## 4 Additional Simple Testing
***
### Subdomain Takeover
Check for unclaimed DNS entries.
```shell
python3 /opt/knock/knock.py <DOMAIN>
```
Potential Impact:  
- **Login Phishing** on official looking URL
- **Leverage** to other vulnerability

### Weak Ciphers (HTTPS)
Check for unsecure cyphers supported by the app. Nmap grades the ciphers, anything less than C is a finding.  
```shell
nmap -p443 --script ssl-enum-ciphers <URL/IP>
```
#### Potential Impact:  
- Attacker could **decript HTTPS traffic** and extract sensitive data (e.g. session cookies)
