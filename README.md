## 1 Determining Scope & Enumeration
***
Limit testing to inscope endpoints only. If no endpoints/domains are specified, look for potential attack vectors other than the main webapp.  
### 1.1. Enumerating Virtual Hosts
```shell
ffuf -u "<URL>" -H "Host:FUZZ.<DOMAIN>" -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt
```
### 1.2. Enumerating Sub Domains
```shell
ffuf -u "http<s>://FUZZ.<DOMAIN>" -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt
```
### 1.3. Enumerate Technology the Web App is build with
Wappalyzer, WPScan  
### 1.4. Enumerating Pages/Endpoints
```shell
gobuster dir -u <URL> -w /opt/SecLists/Discovery/Web-Content/raft-small-words.txt
```

## 2 Understanding Functionality
***
Start by testing the website the intended way:  
- look for potential attack vectors and crutial endpoints
- note any unexpected behavior (like error logs exposed to the user)
- Identify the priviledge classes (unauthenticated, regular user, manager, admin, ...)
- check cookies set

## 4 Additional Simple Testing
***
### 4.1 Subdomain Takeover
Check for unclaimed DNS entries.
```shell
python3 /opt/knock/knock.py <DOMAIN>
```
Potential Impact:  
- **Login Phishing** on official looking URL
- **Leverage** to other vulnerability

### 4.2 Weak Ciphers (HTTPS)
Check for unsecure cyphers supported by the app. Nmap grades the ciphers, anything less than C is a finding.  
```shell
nmap -p443 --script ssl-enum-ciphers <URL/IP>
```
#### Potential Impact:  
- Attacker could **decript HTTPS traffic** and extract sensitive data (e.g. session cookies)
